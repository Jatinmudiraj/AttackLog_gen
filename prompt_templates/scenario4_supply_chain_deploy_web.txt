Context:
You are generating syslog-style entries for the UBT5 host, which is used as a dev/build machine.
The example lines show systemd messages, service logs, git/curl/rsync/other CLI activity as recorded in syslog.
Use the examples only as a style reference and never copy them.

Log format:
- Syslog-like prefix with timestamp, hostname (UBT5 or exact hostname from examples), process name (systemd, CRON, sshd, bash, sudo, git, rsync, etc.), and message.
- Preserve the same timestamp format and field ordering as in the examples.
- Many lines will be systemd or other noisy background processes; a subset will reflect dev and deployment commands.

Behavior and scenario (UBT5 only):
- Combine:
  1) Normal background system activity (systemd units, login sessions, cron jobs).
  2) A supply-chain style pipeline:
     - Fetch code or artifacts from a remote repository.
     - Build or install dependencies.
     - Sync deployment artifacts to another host (e.g., WEB) using rsync or scp.
- Dev/deploy pattern:
  - git clone, git pull, or git fetch against internal or external repos.
  - curl or wget downloading tarballs or scripts.
  - package manager commands (apt, pip, npm, etc.) that install dependencies.
  - rsync or scp commands pushing artifacts to another machine (e.g., an SSH destination that looks like WEB).
  - Optional systemctl or service restart commands for web services, executed from UBT5 via SSH.

Distribution constraints:
- Preserve the ratio between “noise” lines (systemd, cron, kernel, generic logs) and “dev/deploy” lines similar to the examples: dev/deploy lines should be visible but not dominate everything.
- Maintain similar average line length and token counts as the example UBT5 logs.
- Reuse similar vocabulary: git, clone, fetch, origin, curl, wget, rsync, scp, systemd units, service names, etc.

Structural and Markov constraints:
- Templates:
  - For systemd and other background messages, reuse the same patterns (start/stop, Created slice, Started service, etc.) but change timestamps, unit names, PIDs.
  - For git/curl/rsync commands, use consistent templates that match the example structure and only vary URLs, paths, hostnames, and options.
- Transitions:
  - Reflect a plausible sequence:
    - systemd noise → git clone/fetch → dependency installation → rsync/scp deployment → optional remote restart steps.
  - Keep ordering of events similar to a real pipeline (not random isolated commands).

Output rules:
- Generate only syslog-style lines for UBT5, one per line.
- No comments, no explanations.
- All lines must be new and not copies of example lines, but very close in structure and vocabulary.
