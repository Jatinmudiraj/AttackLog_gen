Context:
You are generating Linux audit log entries (auditd) for the UB3 host, where auditd is already configured.
The example lines show type=EXECVE, type=SYSCALL, and related audit messages, including fields such as uid, auid, exe, cmdline, and file paths.
Use examples purely for structure and vocabulary; do not copy them.

Log format:
- Use the same auditd structure as in the examples:
  - "type=EXECVE msg=audit(...): argc=... a0=... a1=... ..." etc.
  - "type=SYSCALL msg=audit(...): arch=... syscall=... success=... uid=... gid=... exe=\"...\" ..." etc.
- Preserve timestamp style and audit IDs (the numeric part inside audit(...)) similar to the examples.
- Maintain the same ordering of key=value fields for each record type.

Behavior and scenario (UB3 only):
- Show activity consistent with:
  1) An attacker already having interactive access on UB3.
  2) Attempts to tamper with logs.
  3) Starting a crypto-miner-like process.
- Log tampering behavior:
  - EXECVE/SYSCALL records where commands like "rm", "truncate", "echo >" or "shred" are executed against log files such as /var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, /var/log/audit/audit.log, or journal directories.
  - File permission changes (chmod, chown) on log-related files or directories.
- Crypto-like behavior:
  - Execution of binaries that resemble miners (names like xmrig, minerd, or disguised with generic names) with command-line options that include pool URLs, wallet addresses, or stratum endpoints.
  - High-frequency repetitive commands or processes that match miner patterns.
- Include some normal background EXECVE/SYSCALL entries (system services, benign commands) similar to the examples so that the attacker activity is blended with noise.

Distribution constraints:
- Keep EXECVE and SYSCALL records as the dominant types, with a similar ratio to the examples.
- Maintain similar average length and field cardinality per log line.
- Use UID/GID patterns that look realistic (e.g., root for destructive commands, non-root users for some benign activity), similar to the examples.

Structural and Markov constraints:
- Templates:
  - Reuse the main templates from the examples: EXECVE records for command invocations; SYSCALL records describing the underlying system call.
  - Only vary timestamps, PIDs, audit IDs, file paths, arguments, and result fields.
- Transitions:
  - Show sequences where EXECVE and SYSCALL pairs correspond to the same command.
  - For log tampering:
    - sequences like EXECVE("rm /var/log/...") followed by SYSCALL success, possibly followed by other related EXECVE/SYSCALL operations.
  - For mining:
    - EXECVE of mining binary → repeated SYSCALL records reflecting its ongoing activity.
- Keep these patterns statistically similar in frequency and ordering to the example logs (e.g., tampering commands are relatively rare compared to all EXECVE/SYSCALL noise).

Output rules:
- Generate only auditd-style lines (type=EXECVE, type=SYSCALL, and any directly related audit types present in examples), one per line.
- No explanation or extra text.
- All lines must be novel while preserving the same format, templates, and vocabulary structure as the examples.
