Context:
You are generating new Apache access.log entries for the DVWA web server host WEB (e.g., 192.168.20.4).
The example lines you see define the exact log format, field order, and typical content.
You must treat those examples as a style reference only and never copy any line.

Log format:
- Standard Apache access log (similar to combined or slightly customized format).
- Keep the same ordering of fields as in the examples:
  client_ip, ident/user, timestamp in square brackets, HTTP method/path/version, status code, response size, referrer, user-agent.
- Preserve typical HTTP methods and versions used in the examples: mostly GET and POST, with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 as appropriate.
- Maintain similar average line length and number of tokens per line as in the examples.

Behavior and scenario (WEB only):
- Model traffic as a mix of:
  1) Normal browsing of DVWA and other site resources.
  2) SQL injection and webshell-related activity from a few attacker IPs.
- Normal traffic:
  - Requests for "/", "/index.php", "/dvwa", "/dvwa/login.php", "/dvwa/setup.php", "/static/*.css", "/static/*.js", images, icons.
  - Typical 200 and 304 responses with realistic sizes.
- Attack traffic:
  - Repeated requests to vulnerable paths like "/dvwa/login.php", "/dvwa/vulnerabilities/sqli/", or similar.
  - Suspicious query strings that look like SQL injection payloads, and webshell access, for example:
    "' OR 1=1 --", "UNION SELECT", "sleep(5)", "benchmark(", "id=1; DROP TABLE".
  - Some requests should look like automated tools (e.g., sqlmap-like user-agents) and some like a manual attacker.
  - Include some 4xx and 5xx status codes (403, 404, 500) around attack activity.

Distribution constraints (to match metrics):
- Keep the rough ratio of:
  - Normal vs attack lines similar to the examples (attack lines should be a minority but clearly present).
  - GET vs POST similar to the examples.
  - 2xx vs 3xx vs 4xx vs 5xx status codes similar to the examples.
- Time:
  - Preserve the spread of timestamps over hours similar to the example: if examples cover multiple hours, your lines should also span similar hours.
- Vocabulary:
  - Reuse the same general vocabulary of paths, file extensions, status codes, referrer patterns, and user-agents as in the examples, but do not copy any full line.

Structural constraints (templates and transitions):
- Maintain the same overall log template structure: only change variable fields like IP, timestamp, path, query parameters, status code, size, and user-agent.
- Ensure there are repeated templates (the same structure with different variable values), so that the number of unique templates and average messages per template stays close to the example logs.
- For attack sequences, produce bursts of similar requests (same path, slightly varying parameters) from the same attacking IP, followed by related error codes or successful responses.

Output rules:
- Generate NEW lines only; never copy or lightly rephrase example lines.
- Output only Apache access log lines, one per line, no extra text or explanation.
